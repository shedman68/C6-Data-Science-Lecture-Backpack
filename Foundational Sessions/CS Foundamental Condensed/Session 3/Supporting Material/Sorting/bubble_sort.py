# Bubble sort

# Step 1 − Check if the first element in the input array is greater than the next element in the array.

# Step 2 − If it is greater, swap the two elements; otherwise move the pointer forward in the array.

# Step 3 − Repeat Step 2 until we reach the end of the array.

# Step 4 − Check if the elements are sorted; if not, repeat the same process (Step 1 to Step 3) from the last element of the array to the first.

# Step 5 − The final output achieved is the sorted array.
