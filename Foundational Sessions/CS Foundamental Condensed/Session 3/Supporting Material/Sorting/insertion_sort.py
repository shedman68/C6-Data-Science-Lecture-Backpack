# Insertion sort

# Step 1 − If it is the first element, it is already sorted. return 1;

# Step 2 − Pick next element

# Step 3 − Compare with all elements in the sorted sub-list

# Step 4 − Shift all the elements in the sorted sub-list that is greater than the value to be sorted

# Step 5 − Insert the value

# Step 6 − Repeat until list is sorted
